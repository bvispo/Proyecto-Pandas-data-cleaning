# Proyecto-Pandas-data-cleaning

In this repository you can find a data cleaning project implemented in a data set that contains information about Shark Attacks.

The goal of this project is to demostrate wheter the next hypothesis are true:

    H0: Women who are attacked by sharks are more likely to die than men. 
    H1:
    H3:

This project has been made trough a combination of data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas, Numpy and Regrex libraries.

In order to do so, two different jupyter notebook files have been used. The first one, named after 1-Cleaning-ipynb, includes all the cleaning process that had been made to reach the conclusions. And, in the second one, called 2-Visualization.ipynb, some insightfull graphs are shown. Thanks to these, we are going to be able to validate the conclusions based on the given hypotsses.

Main conclusions about this project are:

1.
