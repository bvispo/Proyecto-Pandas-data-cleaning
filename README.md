# Proyecto-Pandas-data-cleaning

In this repository you can find a data cleaning project implemented in a data set that contains information about Shark Attacks.

The goal of this project is to demostrate wheter the next hypothesis are true:

    H0: Women who are attacked by sharks are more likely to die than men. 
    H1: In North America, most of the people attacked were surfing.
    H3: In 2018, persons in theirs 30s were the ones who experimented the bigger amount of attacks.

This project has been made trough a combination of data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas, Numpy and Regrex libraries:

        This are the libraries used the cleaning jupyerr:
            import pandas as pd
            import numpy as np
            from numpy import nan
            import re
        This are the libraries used the visualization jupyerr:
            import seaborn as sns
            import pandas as pd
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

In order to do so, two different jupyter notebook files have been used. The first one, named after 1-Cleaning-ipynb, includes all the cleaning process that had been made to reach the conclusions. And, in the second one, called 2-Visualization.ipynb, some insightfull graphs are shown. Thanks to these, we are going to be able to validate the conclusions based on the given hypotsses.

Main conclusions about this project are:

1. In general, more men have been killed by shark attacks than women.
2. Continents where most shark attacks have occurred are North America, Oceania and Africa.
3. The activities that have caused the most shark attacks were: free swimming or diving, surfing and fishing.
4. In North America, which is the continent where most attacks have been recorded, most of the attacks were on people who were surfing.
5. In 2018, people in theis 30s experimented the bigger number of attacks.
